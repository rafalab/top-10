## Introduction

These slides are inspired by:



["Creating effective figures and tables"](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/graphs2017.pdf) by [Karl Broman](http://kbroman.org/). Code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/kbroman/Talk_Graphs) repository. 
[Introduction to Data Visualization course](http://paldhous.github.io/ucb/2016/dataviz/index.html) by Peter Aldhous 

It is a chapter in a data visualization chapter in [this book](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/)

## Introduction

- We show some examples of plot styles we should avoid, explain how to improve them, and use these as motivation for a list of principles.
- We compare and contrast plots that follow these principles to those that don't.

## Introduction

- The principles are mostly based on research related to how humans detect patterns and make visual comparisons.
- The preferred approaches are those that best fit the way our brains process visual information.
- When deciding on a visualization approach it is also important to keep our goal in mind.
- We may be comparing a viewable number of quantities, describing distribution for categories or numeric values, comparing the data from two groups, or describing the relationship between two variables.


## Encoding data using visual cues

- We start by describing some principles for encoding data.
- There are several approaches at our disposal including:
    - position
    - aligned lengths
    - angles
    - area 
    - brightness
    - color hue. 


## First example

- To illustrate how some of these strategies compare let's suppose we want to report the results from two hypothetical polls asking regarding browser preference taken in 2000 and then 2015.

- Here, for each year, we are simply comparing four quantities, four percentages.

- A widely used graphical representation of percentages, popularized by Microsoft Excel, is the pie chart:

## First example


```{r, echo=FALSE}
browsers <- data.frame(Browser = rep(c("Opera","Safari","Firefox","IE","Chrome"),2),
                       Year = rep(c(2000, 2015), each = 5),
                       Percentage = c(3,21,23,28,26, 2,22,21,27,29)) %>%
  mutate(Browser = reorder(Browser, Percentage))

p1 <- browsers %>% ggplot(aes(x = "", y = Percentage, fill = Browser)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity", col = "black")  + coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  theme_excel() + xlab("") + ylab("") +
  theme(axis.text=element_blank(), 
        axis.ticks = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid  = element_blank()) +
  facet_grid(.~Year)
p1
```

## Encoding data with angles and areas: not recommended

- Here we are representing quantities with both areas and angles since both the angle and area of each pie slice is proportional to the quantity it represents.

- This turns out to be a sub optimal choice since, as demonstrated by perception studies, humans are not good at precisely quantifying angles and are even worse when only are is available.

## Encoding data with just area: even less recommended


```{r donutchart, fig.cap="Pie chart of browser usage.", echo=FALSE}
browsers %>% ggplot(aes(x = 2, y = Percentage, fill = Browser)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity", col = "black")  + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0.5,2.5)) + coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  theme_excel() + xlab("") + ylab("") +
  theme(axis.text=element_blank(), 
        axis.ticks = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid  = element_blank()) +
  facet_grid(.~Year)

```

## Pie charts

-  To see how hard it is to quantify angles and are note that the rankings and all the percentages in the plots above changed fro 2000 to 2015.

- Can you determine the actual percentages and rank the browsers' popularity? Can you see how the percentages changed from 2000 to 2015? It is not easy to tell from the plot.


## Pie charts

-  In this case, simply showing the numbers is not only clearer, but it would saves on print cost if making a paper version. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
browsers %>% spread(Year, Percentage) %>% knitr::kable()
```

## barplots

-  The preferred way to plot quantities is to use length and position since humans are much better at judging linear measure.

- The barplot uses bars use this approach by using bars of length proportional to the quantities of interest.

- By adding horizontal lines at strategically chosen values, in this case at every multiple of 10, we ease the quantifying through the position of the top of the bars.

## pie chart vs barplots

```{r barplot, fig.height = 5, echo=FALSE}
p2 <-browsers %>%
  ggplot(aes(Browser, Percentage)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width=0.5, fill=4, col = 1) +
  ylab("Percent using the Browser") +
  facet_grid(.~Year)
grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 2)
```


## If forced to make a pie chart at percentages

```{r, eaco = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(scales)
browsers <- filter(browsers, Year == 2015)
at <- with(browsers, 100 - cumsum(c(0,Percentage[-length(Percentage)])) - 0.5*Percentage)  
label <- percent(browsers$Percentage/100)
browsers %>% ggplot(aes(x = "", y = Percentage, fill = Browser)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity", col = "black")  + coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  theme_excel() + xlab("") + ylab("") + ggtitle("2015") +
  theme(axis.text=element_blank(), 
        axis.ticks = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid  = element_blank()) +
annotate(geom = "text", 
              x = 1.62, 
              y =  at, 
              label = label, size=4)
```

## Visual cues

- Position and length are the preferred ways to display quantities over angles which are preferred to area.

- Brightness and color are even harder to quantifying that angles and area but, as we will see later, they are sometimes useful when more than two dimensions are being displayed.

## When to include 0

- When using length (e.g. barplots) it is misleading not to start the bars at 0.

- This is because, by using a barplot, we are implying the length is proportional to the quantities being displayed.

- By avoiding 0, relatively small difference can be made to look much bigger than they actually are.

- This approach is often used by politicians or media organizations trying to exaggerate a difference.

## Example

- (Source: Fox News, via Media Matters via Fox News via [Peter Aldhous](http://paldhous.github.io/ucb/2016/dataviz/week2.html) 


## Same data with plot that includes 0

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data.frame(Year = as.character(c(2011, 2012, 2013)),Southwest_Border_Apprehensions = c(165244,170223,192298)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(Year, Southwest_Border_Apprehensions )) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "yellow", col = "black", width = 0.65) 
```

## Another example 

![](http://i2.wp.com/flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Bush-cuts.png)

-  Via Fox News via [Flowingdata](http://flowingdata.com/2012/08/06/fox-news-continues-charting-excellence/)


## Same data with plot the includes 0

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5}
data.frame(date = c("Now", "Jan 1, 2013"), tax_rate = c(35, 39.6)) %>%
  mutate(date = reorder(date, tax_rate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(date, tax_rate)) + ylab("") + xlab("") +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "yellow", col = "black", width = 0.5) + 
  ggtitle("Top Tax Rate If Bush Tax Cut Expires")
```

## When not to include 0

- When using position rather than length, it is **not** necessary to include 0.

- This is particularly the case when we want to compare differences between groups relative the variability seen within the groups.


## Example: Life expectancy by continent in 2012 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=8}
p1 <- gapminder %>% filter(year == 2012) %>%
  ggplot(aes(continent, life_expectancy)) +
  geom_point()
p2 <- p1 +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 84))
grid.arrange(p2, p1, ncol = 2)
```

## Do not distrort quantities


![](http://paldhous.github.io/ucb/2016/dataviz/img/class2_30.jpg)

(Source: President Barack Obamaâ€™s 2011 State of the Union Address via [Peter Aldhous] (http://paldhous.github.io/ucb/2016/dataviz/index.html))

## Do not distrort quantities

- The reason for this distortion is that the radius, rather than the area, was made to be proportional to the quantity.
- This implies that the proportion between the areas is squared: 2.6 turns into 6.5 and 5.8 turns into 34.1.

## Use area not radius

```{r, echo = FALSE}
gdp <- c(14.6, 5.7, 5.3, 3.3, 2.5)
gdp_data <- data.frame(Country = rep(c("United States", "China", "Japan", "Germany", "France"),2),
           y = factor(rep(c("Radius","Area"),each=5), levels = c("Radius", "Area")),
           GDP= c(gdp^2/min(gdp^2), gdp/min(gdp))) %>% 
   mutate(Country = reorder(Country, GDP))
gdp_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Country, y, size = GDP)) + 
  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE, color = "blue") + 
  scale_size(range = c(2,30)) +
  coord_flip() + ylab("") + xlab("")
```

## But we should not be using area or radius
 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
gdp_data %>% filter(y == "Area") %>% ggplot(aes(Country, GDP)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + ylab("GDP in trillions of US dollars")
```

## Order by a meaningful value

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data(murders)
p1 <- murders %>% mutate(murder_rate = total / population * 100000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(state, murder_rate)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab("")
p1
```

## Order by a meaningful value

- When one of the axes is used to show categories, as is done in barplots, the default ggplot behavior is to order the categories alphabetically when they are defined by character strings.
- If they are defined by factors, they are ordered by the factor levels.
- We rarely want to use alphabetical order.
- Instead we should order by a meaningful quantity.

## Order by a meaningful value

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=8}
data(murders)
p1 <- murders %>% mutate(murder_rate = total / population * 100000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(state, murder_rate)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab("")

p2 <- murders %>% mutate(murder_rate = total / population * 100000) %>%
  mutate(state = reorder(state, murder_rate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(state, murder_rate)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab("")
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
```

## Another example: Average income by region in 1970 (colors = continent)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=8}
past_year <- 1970
p1 <- gapminder %>% 
  mutate(dollars_per_day = gdp/population/365) %>%
  filter(year == past_year & !is.na(gdp)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(region, dollars_per_day, fill = continent)) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend=FALSE) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  xlab("")
p2 <- gapminder %>% 
  mutate(dollars_per_day = gdp/population/365) %>%
  filter(year == past_year & !is.na(gdp)) %>%
  mutate(region = reorder(region, dollars_per_day, FUN = median)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(region, dollars_per_day, fill = continent)) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend=FALSE) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  xlab("")
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol=2)
```


## Show the data

- To motivate this principle let's asssume an extraterrestrial is interested is the difference in heights between males and females.

- A commonly seen plot used for comparisons between groups, popularized by software such as Microsoft Excel, shows the average and standard errors (standard errors are defined in a later chapter, but don't confuse them with the standard deviation of the data).

## Show the data


```{r, echo=FALSE}
data(heights)
p1 <- heights %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarize(average = mean(height), se=sd(height)/sqrt(n())) %>%
  ggplot(aes(sex, average)) + theme_excel() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = average - 2*se, ymax = average+2*se), width = 0.25)+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width=0.5, fill=4, col = 1) +
  ylab("Height in inches")
p1
```

## Show the data

```{r, echo=FALSE}
heights %>% ggplot(aes(sex, height)) + geom_point() 
```

## Show the data

- What do we learn? We get an idea of the range of the data.
- However this plot has limitations as well since we can't really see all the `r sum(heights$sex=="Female")` and `r sum(heights$sex=="Male")` points plotted for females and males respectively, and many points are plotted above each other.

## jitter and alpha blending

```{r, echo=FALSE}
heights %>% ggplot(aes(sex, height)) + geom_jitter(width = 0.1, alpha = 0.2) 
```

## Show the data

- What do we learn? On average, males are taller than females.

- We also note dark horizontal demonstrating that many report values are rounded to the nearest integer.

- Since there are so many points it is more effective to show distributions, rather than show individual points.

## Compare distributions if too many points


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=8}
heights %>% 
  ggplot(aes(height, ..density..)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color="black") +
  facet_grid(.~sex, scales = "free_x")
```

## Ease comparisons: Use common axes

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=8}
heights %>% 
  ggplot(aes(height, ..density..)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color="black") +
  facet_grid(.~sex)
```

## Ease comparisons:  align vertically

```{r, echo=FALSE}
p2 <- heights %>% 
  ggplot(aes(height, ..density..)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color="black") +
  facet_grid(sex~.)
p2
```

## Ease comparisons

-  This plot makes it much easier to notice that men are, on average, taller. 

- If instead of histograms we want the more compact summary provided by boxplot, then we align the horizontally, since, by default, boxplots move up and down with changes in height.

## Ease comparisons: align horizontally

```{r,echo=FALSE}
p3 <- heights %>% 
  ggplot(aes(sex, height)) + 
  geom_boxplot(coef=3) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, alpha = 0.2) +
  ylab("Height in inches")
p3
```

## Comparison

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol = 3)
```

## Consider transformations

- As an example consider this barplot showing the average population sizes for each continent in 2015:

## Consider transformations

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data(gapminder)
p1 <- gapminder %>% filter(year == 2015) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>% summarize(population = mean(population)) %>%
  mutate(continent = reorder(continent, population)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(continent, population/10^6)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width=0.5, fill=4) +
  theme_excel() + 
  ylab("Population in Millions") +
  xlab("Continent")
p1
```

## Show the data

```{r ,echo=FALSE}
p2 <- gapminder %>% filter(year == 2015) %>% 
  mutate(continent = reorder(continent, population, mean)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(continent, population/10^6)) + 
  ylab("Population in Millions") +
  xlab("Continent")
p2 +  geom_jitter(width = .1, alpha = .5) 
```

## Consider transformations

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
p2 <- p2 + geom_boxplot(coef=3) + 
   geom_jitter(width = .1, alpha = .5) + scale_y_log10(breaks = c(1,10,100,1000))
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
```

## Ease comparisons

- Visual cues to be compared should be adjacent

- When comparing income data between 1970 and 2010 across region we made a figure similar to the one below.

- A difference is that here we look at continents instead of regions, but this is not relevant to the point we are making. 

## Ease comparisons

```{r, echo=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(1970, 2010) & !is.na(gdp)) %>%
  mutate(dollars_per_day = gdp/population/365) %>%
  mutate(labels = paste(year, continent)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(labels, dollars_per_day)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log2") + 
  ylab("Income in dollars per day")
```

## Comparisons should be adjacent

```{r, echo=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(1970, 2010) & !is.na(gdp)) %>%
  mutate(dollars_per_day = gdp/population/365) %>%
  mutate(labels = paste(continent, year)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(labels, dollars_per_day)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log2") + 
  ylab("Income in dollars per day")
```

## Use color to highlight comparison

```{r,echo=FALSE}
 gapminder %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(1970, 2010) & !is.na(gdp)) %>%
  mutate(dollars_per_day = gdp/population/365, year = factor(year)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(continent, dollars_per_day, fill = year)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log2") + 
  ylab("Income in dollars per day")
```

## Think of the color blind

- About 10% of the population is color blind.
- Unfortunately, the default colors used in ggplot are not optimal for this group.
- However, ggplot does it make it easy to change the color palette used in the plots.

## Think of the color blind

- Here is an example of how we can use color blind friendly pallet described [here](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/#a-colorblind-friendly-palette): 

## Think of the color blind

```{r, echo=FALSE}
color_blind_friendly_cols <- c("#999999", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7")
p1 <- data.frame(x=1:8, y=1:8, col = as.character(1:8)) %>% ggplot(aes(x, y, color = col)) + geom_point(size=5)
p1 + scale_color_manual(values=color_blind_friendly_cols)
```

## Think of the color blind

-  There are several resources that help you select colors, for example [this one](http://bconnelly.net/2013/10/creating-colorblind-friendly-figures/). 

## Use scatter-plots to examine the relationship between two variables

Exceptions are

- Slope charts

- Bland-Altman plots

## Slope charts

```{r,echo=FALSE}
west <- c("Western Europe","Northern Europe","Southern Europe",
          "Northern America","Australia and New Zealand")

dat <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year%in% c(2010, 2015) & region %in% west & 
           !is.na(life_expectancy) & population > 10^7) 

dat %>%
  mutate(location = ifelse(year == 2010, 1, 2), 
         location = ifelse(year == 2015 & country%in%c("United Kingdom","Portugal"), location+0.22, location),
         hjust = ifelse(year == 2010, 1, 0)) %>%
  mutate(year = as.factor(year)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, life_expectancy, group = country)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = country), show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_text(aes(x = location, label = country, hjust = hjust), 
            show.legend = FALSE) +
  xlab("") + ylab("Life Expectancy")
```

## Scatter plot (with common axes)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggrepel)
west <- c("Western Europe","Northern Europe","Southern Europe",
          "Northern America","Australia and New Zealand")

dat <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year%in% c(2010, 2015) & region %in% west & 
           !is.na(life_expectancy) & population > 10^7) 

dat %>% 
   mutate(year = paste0("life_expectancy_", year)) %>%
   select(country, year, life_expectancy) %>% spread(year, life_expectancy) %>% 
   ggplot(aes(x=life_expectancy_2010,y=life_expectancy_2015, label = country)) + geom_point() + geom_text_repel() +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(78.5, 83)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(78.5, 83)) +
  geom_abline(lty = 2) +
  xlab("2010") + ylab("2015")
```


## Bland-Altman plot

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggrepel)
dat %>% 
   mutate(year = paste0("life_expectancy_", year)) %>%
   select(country, year, life_expectancy) %>% spread(year, life_expectancy) %>% 
  mutate(average = (life_expectancy_2015 + life_expectancy_2010)/2,
         difference = life_expectancy_2015 - life_expectancy_2010) %>%
  ggplot(aes(average, difference, label = country)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel() +
  geom_abline(lty = 2) +
  xlab("Average of 2010 and 2015") + ylab("Difference between 2015 and 2010")
```

## Encoding a third variable

```{r, echo=FALSE}
present_year <- 2010

dat <- gapminder %>%
  mutate(region = case_when(
    .$region %in% west ~ "The West",
    .$region %in% "Northern Africa" ~ "Northern Africa",
    .$region %in% c("Eastern Asia", "South-Eastern Asia") ~ "East Asia",
    .$region == "Southern Asia"~ "Southern Asia",
    .$region %in% c("Central America", "South America", "Caribbean") ~ "Latin America",
    .$continent == "Africa" & .$region != "Northern Africa" ~ "Sub-Saharan Africa",
    .$region %in% c("Melanesia", "Micronesia", "Polynesia") ~ "Pacific Islands"),
    dollars_per_day = gdp / population / 365) %>%
  filter(year %in% present_year & !is.na(gdp) & !is.na(infant_mortality) & !is.na(region) ) %>%
  mutate(OPEC = ifelse(country%in%opec, "Yes", "No")) 

dat %>% 
  ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day, 1 - infant_mortality/1000, 
             col = region, size = population/10^6,
             pch =  OPEC)) +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2", limits=c(0.25, 150)) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "logit",limit=c(0.875, .9981),
                     breaks=c(.85,.90,.95,.99,.995,.998)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) 
```

## Encoding a third variable

- Note that we encode categorical variables with color hue and shape.
- These shape can be controlled with `shape`  argument.
- Below are the shapes available for use in R.
- Note that for the last five, the color goes inside. 

## Encoding a third variable

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dat=data.frame(x=c(0:25))
ggplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
        axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank(),
        axis.title.y=element_blank(),
        axis.text.y=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y=element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
scale_shape_identity() + scale_y_reverse() +
geom_point(dat, mapping=aes(x%%9, x%/%9, shape=x), size=10, fill="blue") +
geom_text(dat, mapping=aes(x%%9, x%/%9+0.25, label=x), size=6) 
```

## Encoding a third variable

- For continuous variables we can use color, intensity or size.
- We now show an example of how we do this with a case study.

## Example

- The data used for these plots were collected, organized and distributed by the [Tycho Project](http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/).
- They include weekly reported counts data for seven diseases from 1928 to 2011, from all fifty states.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data(us_contagious_diseases)
```
 
## One state is easy 
```{r, echo=FALSE}

## We need other cues for third dimenion

- When choosing colors to quantify a numeric variable  we chose between two options sequential and diverging.

- Sequential colors are suited for data that goes from high to low.
- High values are clearly distinguished from low values.
- Here are some examples offered by the package `RColorBrewer` 

## Paletts

-  Diverging colors are used to represent values that diverge from a center.
- We put equal emphasis on both ends of the data range: higher than the center and lower than the center.
- An example of when we would use a divergent pattern would be if we were to show height in standard deviations away from the average.
- Here are some examples of divergent patterns: 

## Sequential Paletts

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(RColorBrewer)
display.brewer.all(type="seq")
```


## Divergent Paletts

```{r}
library(RColorBrewer)
display.brewer.all(type="div")
```

## Example 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=8}
dat %>% ggplot(aes(year, state,  fill = rate)) +
  geom_tile(color = "grey50") +
  scale_x_continuous(expand=c(0,0)) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = brewer.pal(9, "Reds"), trans = "sqrt") +
  geom_vline(xintercept=1963, col = "blue") +
  theme_minimal() +  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) +
  ggtitle(the_disease) + 
  ylab("") + 
  xlab("")
```

## Alternative: eliminate one variable

```{r, echo=FALSE}
avg <- us_contagious_diseases %>%
  filter(disease==the_disease) %>% group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(us_rate = sum(count, na.rm=TRUE)/sum(population, na.rm=TRUE)*10000)
dat %>% ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(year, rate, group = state),  color = "grey50", 
            show.legend = FALSE, alpha = 0.2, size = 1) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(year, us_rate),  data = avg, size = 1, color = "black") +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "sqrt", breaks = c(5,25,125,300)) + 
  ggtitle("Cases per 10,000 by state") + 
  xlab("") + 
  ylab("") +
  geom_text(data = data.frame(x=1955, y=50), mapping = aes(x, y, label="US average"), color="black") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept=1963, col = "blue") 
```

## Avoid pseudo three dimensional plots

## Avoid pseudo three dimensional plots

```{r colors-for-different-lines, echo=FALSE}
##First read data
url <- "https://github.com/kbroman/Talk_Graphs/raw/master/R/fig8dat.csv"
dat <- read.csv(url)

##Now make alternative plot
dat %>% gather(drug, survival, -log.dose) %>%
  mutate(drug = gsub("Drug.","",drug)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(log.dose, survival, color = drug)) +
  geom_line()    
```

## Avoid gratuitousthree dimensional plots

- Pseudo 3D is sometimes used completely gratuitously: plots are made to look 3D even when the 3rd dimension does not represent a quantity.
- This only adds confusion and makes it harder to relay your message.

## Avoid too any significant digits

- By default, statistical software like R returns many significant digits.
- The default behavior in R is to show 7 significant digits.
- So many digits often adds no information and the visual clutter than can makes it hard for the consumer of your table to understand the message.
- As an example here are the per 10,000 disease rates for California across the five decades 

## Avoid too any significant digits

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tmp <- options()$digits
options(digits=7)
dat <- us_contagious_diseases %>%
  filter(year %in% seq(1940,1980,10) &  state == "California" &
          disease %in% c("Measles","Pertussis","Polio")) %>%
  mutate(rate = count / population * 10000) %>% 
  mutate(state = reorder(state, rate)) %>% 
  select(state, year, disease, rate) %>%
  spread(disease, rate)
dat %>% knitr::kable()
options(digits=tmp)
```

## Avoid too any significant digits

-  We are reporting precision up to 0.00001 cases per 10,000, a very small value in the context the changes that are occurring across the dates.
- In this case 2 significant figure is more than enough and makes the point that rates are decreasing clearly: 

## Avoid too any significant digits

```{r, echo = FALSE}
dat %>% mutate_each(funs(round(., digits=1)), -c(state, year)) %>% knitr::kable()
```


## Compare vertically

-  Another principle, related to displaying tables, is to place values being compared on columns rather than rows.

## Compare vertically 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
dat %>% mutate_each(funs(round(., digits=1)), -c(state, year)) %>% knitr::kable()
```

## Do not compare horizontally

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dat <- us_contagious_diseases %>%
  filter(year %in% seq(1940,1980,10) &  state == "California" &
          disease %in% c("Measles","Pertussis","Polio")) %>%
  mutate(rate = count / population * 10000) %>% 
  mutate(state = reorder(state, rate)) %>% 
  select(state, year, disease, rate) %>%
  spread(year, rate)
dat %>% mutate_each(funs(round(., digits=1)), -c(state, disease)) %>% knitr::kable()
```
